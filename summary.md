# Fibroid Research Summary for Amy

*Compiled: 2026-02-07 by Hazel 🍂*
*AI-generated research — verify with your healthcare provider*

## Your Situation
- 6.1cm subserosal fibroid (main one) + 1.9cm intramural
- Currently taking: Iron, DIM, physical therapy
- PT is helping with prolapse ✓
- Hysterectomy recommended, but you're exploring alternatives

## What the Research Says

### 1. Good News About Your Approach
You're already doing several right things:
- **Iron** — Good for managing anemia from bleeding
- **Physical therapy** — Smart for prolapse, working for you
- **Conservative management** — Legitimate approach for your fibroid size

### 2. Upgrade Your Supplement Stack

| Supplement | Evidence for Fibroids | Recommendation |
|------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Vitamin D** | ✅ Strong (multiple RCTs, meta-analysis) | ADD if not taking — check levels first |
| **EGCG (Green Tea)** | ✅ Good (RCT showed 32.6% shrinkage) | ADD — 800mg green tea extract daily |
| **DIM** | ⚠️ Indirect (estrogen modulation, no fibroid studies) | Can continue, but don't rely on it |
| **Iron** | ➡️ Symptom support | Continue |

### 3. Key Numbers from Studies

**Vitamin D Meta-Analysis (2024):**
- Significantly decreased fibroid size across 5 RCTs
- Women with fibroids have 5.5 ng/mL lower vitamin D levels

**Green Tea Extract RCT (2013):**
- 32.6% fibroid volume reduction in 4 months
- Placebo group fibroids GREW 24.3%
- Symptom severity improved 32%
- Bleeding decreased from 71mL → 45mL/month

### 4. Non-Surgical Options If Needed

If supplements + PT aren't enough:
1. **UAE** — Blocks blood supply, shrinks fibroids. Less invasive than surgery.
2. **MRI-guided focused ultrasound** — Completely non-invasive, destroys fibroid with heat. Worth asking if you're a candidate.
3. **Myomectomy** — Surgical removal of fibroids, keeps uterus. Better outcomes than UAE in the FEMME trial.

### 5. Is 6cm Manageable?

Yes, with caveats:
- 6cm is in the "commonly needs treatment" range
- BUT yours is subserosal (grows outward, less bleeding impact)
- Conservative management reasonable while symptoms are controlled
- Recommend: Annual ultrasound to track size

## My Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:**
1. ✅ Get vitamin D levels checked
2. ✅ Start vitamin D supplementation (discuss dose with doctor — studies used 50,000 IU/week)
3. ✅ Add EGCG/green tea extract (800mg daily)
4. ✅ Continue iron + PT
5. ⚠️ DIM can stay but don't expect it to shrink fibroids

**Monitoring:**
- Annual ultrasound to track fibroid size
- If fibroids grow or symptoms worsen → discuss UAE or myomectomy
- Hysterectomy remains backup option, not first line

**Questions for Your Doctor:**
1. What are my current vitamin D levels?
2. Am I a candidate for UAE or focused ultrasound?
3. Would you support watchful waiting + supplements for 6-12 months with follow-up imaging?
