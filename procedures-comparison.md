# Non-Surgical & Surgical Options for Fibroids

## Context: Amy's Fibroids
- **Large subserosal:** 6.1cm, 82.9cc — this drives the hysterectomy recommendation
- **Small intramural:** 1.9cm — likely not a concern

Subserosal fibroids grow *outward* from the uterus, so they typically cause fewer bleeding issues but more bulk/pressure symptoms.

## Non-Surgical Options

### Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE)

**What it is:** Interventional radiology procedure that blocks blood supply to fibroids, causing them to shrink.

**Evidence:**
- FEMME Trial (NEJM 2020, PMID 32726530): Compared UAE vs myomectomy
  - Both effective
  - Myomectomy had better quality of life outcomes at 2 years
  - UAE had faster recovery
- 794 studies on PubMed — very well-established

**Pros:**
- Minimally invasive (no major surgery)
- Preserves uterus
- Quick recovery (1-2 weeks)
- One-time procedure

**Cons:**
- May affect future fertility (but increasingly used in women wanting pregnancy)
- 15-20% may need additional treatment
- Not ideal for very large fibroids (>10cm)
- Post-embolization syndrome (pain, fever) common

**Relevance for Amy:** 6cm fibroid is reasonable size for UAE if she wants to avoid surgery.

### MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS / HIFU)

**What it is:** High-intensity ultrasound waves focused on fibroid to heat and destroy tissue, guided by MRI.

**Pros:**
- Completely non-invasive (no incisions)
- Outpatient procedure
- Quick recovery

**Cons:**
- Not all fibroids are treatable (location, size limits)
- Less effective for very large fibroids
- May need multiple sessions
- Not available everywhere

**Relevance for Amy:** Worth asking if her fibroid location is suitable.

### GnRH Agonists (Lupron, etc.)

**What it is:** Medications that temporarily shut down estrogen production, shrinking fibroids.

**Pros:**
- Can shrink fibroids 30-50%
- Used before surgery to reduce size

**Cons:**
- Temporary — fibroids regrow when stopped
- Causes menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, bone loss)
- Usually limited to 6 months
- Not a long-term solution

**Relevance:** Sometimes used to shrink fibroids before other procedures.

### Ulipristal Acetate (Fibristal/Esmya)

**What it is:** Selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) that shrinks fibroids.

**Status:** Approved in some countries (Canada, EU) but has liver safety concerns. FDA hasn't approved for US. Was pulled from some markets.

**Note:** Newer SPRMs are in development with better safety profiles.

## Surgical Options

### Myomectomy (Fibroid Removal)

**What it is:** Surgical removal of fibroids while preserving uterus.

**Types:**
- **Laparoscopic/Robotic** — minimally invasive, small incisions
- **Abdominal** — larger incision, needed for big fibroids
- **Hysteroscopic** — through vagina, only for submucosal fibroids (not Amy's type)

**FEMME Trial Results:**
- Better quality of life outcomes than UAE at 2 years
- 87% satisfaction rate

**Pros:**
- Preserves uterus and fertility
- Removes the fibroids completely
- Long-term symptom relief

**Cons:**
- More invasive than UAE
- Recovery 2-6 weeks depending on approach
- Fibroids can recur (15-30% need additional treatment)
- Risk of adhesions

**Relevance for Amy:** If surgery is considered, myomectomy is the uterus-preserving option.

### Hysterectomy (Uterus Removal)

**What it is:** Complete removal of uterus. Definitive cure for fibroids.

**The recommendation Amy received** — but she's exploring alternatives first.

**Pros:**
- 100% effective — fibroids can't recur
- No more periods or bleeding issues
- Definitive solution

**Cons:**
- Major surgery (2-6 week recovery)
- Permanent — no future pregnancies
- Can affect pelvic floor if done poorly
- Psychological impact for some women
- Possible earlier menopause if ovaries removed

**When it makes sense:**
- Fibroids causing severe symptoms
- Failed other treatments
- Done with childbearing
- Very large or numerous fibroids

## Size Thresholds: When is 6cm Too Big?

There's no absolute cutoff, but guidelines suggest:

- **<3cm:** Usually watchable, rarely need intervention
- **3-5cm:** Monitor, treat if symptomatic
- **5-10cm:** Often symptomatic, treatment commonly needed
- **>10cm:** Usually requires intervention

**Amy's 6cm fibroid** falls in the "commonly needs treatment" range, BUT:
- It's **subserosal** (less bleeding impact)
- She's already managing with supplements + PT
- Conservative management is reasonable if symptoms are controlled

---

## Key Takeaway

Conservative management with supplements (especially vitamin D + EGCG with evidence) is reasonable for Amy's situation while:
1. Monitoring fibroid size (annual ultrasound)
2. Managing symptoms with PT for prolapse
3. Keeping non-surgical options (UAE, focused ultrasound) in the back pocket

Hysterectomy is always available as a definitive option, but exploring alternatives first is valid.
