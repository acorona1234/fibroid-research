# Fibroid Research Project

**Started:** 2026-02-07
**Goal:** Evidence-based research on non-surgical fibroid management options

## Amy's Case (Oct 2024 imaging)

### Fibroid 1 — Large, Subserosal
- **Location:** Middle fundus (top of uterus), grows outward
- **Size:** 6.1 x 4.9 x 5.3 cm
- **Volume:** 82.9 cc (~tennis ball)
- **Appearance:** Heterogeneous

### Fibroid 2 — Small, Intramural
- **Location:** Left corpus (in uterine wall)
- **Size:** 1.9 x 1.2 x 1.4 cm
- **Volume:** 1.7 cc
- **Appearance:** Hypoechoic

## Current Management
- Iron supplements
- DIM supplements
- Physical therapy (reduced prolapse)
- Hysterectomy recommended but exploring alternatives

## Research Focus Areas
1. Evidence on DIM for fibroids
2. Other supplements with research backing (Vitamin D, EGCG, NAC, etc.)
3. Non-surgical interventions (UAE, focused ultrasound, GnRH agonists)
4. Size thresholds — when is conservative management viable?
5. Prolapse management alongside fibroids
