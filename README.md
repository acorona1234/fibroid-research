## Quick Summary

| Supplement | Evidence Level | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| **Vitamin D** | ✅ Strong | Multiple RCTs, meta-analysis shows shrinkage |
| **EGCG (Green Tea)** | ✅ Good | RCT showed 32.6% volume reduction |
| **DIM** | ⚠️ Indirect | Estrogen modulation, no direct fibroid studies |

## Vitamin D — Strong Evidence

**Bottom line:** Multiple RCTs show vitamin D can shrink fibroids or prevent growth.

### Meta-analysis (2024) — PMID 38234246
- 5 RCTs, 511 participants
- Vitamin D significantly decreased fibroid size (SMD: -0.48)
- Stronger effect with >8 weeks supplementation (SMD: -0.62)

### RCT (2020) — PMID 32379687
- 12-week trial
- Vitamin D group: fibroids stayed stable
- Placebo group: fibroids **grew** significantly

### Why It Works
- Women with fibroids have significantly lower vitamin D levels (~5.5 ng/mL difference)
- Vitamin D has anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects on fibroid cells

### Dosing
- Most studies used 50,000 IU weekly or equivalent daily doses
- Duration: 8+ weeks needed for effect
- Check your levels first — aim for 30+ ng/mL

## EGCG (Green Tea Extract) — Good Evidence

**Bottom line:** One solid RCT showed 32.6% fibroid volume reduction in 4 months.

### Pilot RCT (2013) — PMID 23950663
- 39 women with symptomatic fibroids (33 completed)
- Treatment: 800mg green tea extract (45% EGCG) daily for 4 months
- Results:
  - **32.6% reduction** in fibroid volume (vs 24.3% INCREASE in placebo)
  - 32.4% improvement in symptom severity
  - Anemia improved by 0.7 g/dL
  - Menstrual bleeding decreased from 71mL to 45mL/month
- No adverse effects observed

### Ongoing: FRIEND Trial — PMID 38216200
- Multicenter RCT currently studying EGCG for fibroids + fertility

### Why It Works
- Anti-proliferative (stops fibroid cells from multiplying)
- Anti-fibrotic (reduces abnormal tissue formation)
- Induces apoptosis in fibroid cells

### Dosing & Tips
- Study used 800mg green tea extract containing 45% EGCG (~360mg EGCG)
- **Recommended product:** Life Extension Mega Green Tea Extract (326mg EGCG, Labdoor verified 97.4/100)
- Take on empty stomach (morning)
- Take with vitamin C for better absorption
- Avoid protein/dairy for 30 min (blocks absorption)

## DIM (Diindolylmethane) — Indirect/Theoretical

**Bottom line:** NO direct studies on DIM for fibroids.

- Zero PubMed results for "DIM + uterine fibroids"
- Evidence exists for estrogen metabolism modulation
- Theoretical rationale: fibroids are estrogen-dependent
- **Verdict:** Can continue taking, but don't rely on it for fibroid shrinkage

## Non-Surgical Procedures

### UAE (Uterine Artery Embolization)
- Blocks blood supply to fibroids, causing shrinkage
- Minimally invasive (interventional radiology)
- Quick recovery (1-2 weeks)
- FEMME Trial (NEJM 2020): Both UAE and myomectomy effective; myomectomy had slightly better QoL outcomes

### MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS)
- Completely non-invasive (no incisions)
- Uses heat to destroy fibroid tissue
- Not all fibroids are candidates (location/size limits)

### Myomectomy
- Surgical removal of fibroids, preserves uterus
- Better quality of life outcomes than UAE in trials
- Recovery: 2-6 weeks depending on approach

### Hysterectomy
- Definitive cure (100% effective)
- Major surgery, permanent
- Appropriate when other treatments fail or symptoms severe

---

## Size Thresholds

- **<3cm:** Usually watchable
- **3-5cm:** Monitor, treat if symptomatic
- **5-10cm:** Often needs treatment
- **>10cm:** Usually requires intervention

Subserosal fibroids (grow outward) typically cause fewer bleeding issues but more bulk/pressure symptoms.

## Recommended Protocol

### 1. Vitamin D
- **Check your levels first** — aim for 30+ ng/mL
- **Dose:** 50,000 IU weekly (or ~7,000 IU daily) — based on study protocols
- **When:** Take with a meal containing fat for better absorption
- **Duration:** 8+ weeks minimum for effect on fibroids
- **Product:** [Search Amazon for Vitamin D3 50,000 IU](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=vitamin+d3+50000+iu+third+party+tested)

### 2. EGCG (Green Tea Extract)
- **Product:** [Life Extension Mega Green Tea Extract](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Life+Extension+Mega+Green+Tea+Extract) — Labdoor verified 97.4/100, 326mg EGCG per capsule
- **Dose:** 1 capsule daily (~326mg EGCG, matches study dose of ~360mg)
- **When:** Take in the morning on an empty stomach
- **With:** Vitamin C (or citrus fruit) for better absorption
- **Avoid:** Protein and dairy for 30 minutes (blocks absorption)
- **Duration:** Study showed results at 4 months

### 3. Iron
- Continue for anemia support (symptom management, not fibroid shrinkage)

### 4. DIM
- Can continue, but deprioritize — no direct fibroid evidence

### 5. Monitoring
- 📅 Annual ultrasound to track fibroid size
- 💬 Discuss UAE/focused ultrasound options with doctor if needed
