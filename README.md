## Quick Summary

| Supplement | Evidence Level | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| **Vitamin D** | ✅ Strong | Multiple RCTs, meta-analysis shows shrinkage |
| **EGCG (Green Tea)** | ✅ Good | RCT showed 32.6% volume reduction |
| **DIM** | ⚠️ Indirect | Estrogen modulation, no direct fibroid studies |

## Key Findings

### Vitamin D (Meta-analysis, 2024)
- 5 RCTs with 511 participants
- Significantly decreased fibroid size
- Women with fibroids have ~5.5 ng/mL lower vitamin D

### EGCG / Green Tea Extract (RCT, 2013)
- 800mg/day for 4 months
- 32.6% fibroid volume reduction (placebo grew 24%)
- Symptom severity improved 32%
- Bleeding reduced from 71mL → 45mL/month

### DIM
- Zero direct studies on fibroids in PubMed
- Theoretical benefit via estrogen metabolism
- Not proven for fibroid shrinkage

## Non-Surgical Options

1. **UAE (Uterine Artery Embolization)** — Blocks blood supply, minimally invasive
2. **MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound** — Non-invasive heat ablation
3. **Myomectomy** — Surgical removal, preserves uterus
