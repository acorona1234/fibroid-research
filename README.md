## Quick Summary

| Supplement | Evidence Level | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| **Vitamin D** | ✅ Strong | Multiple RCTs, meta-analysis shows shrinkage |
| **EGCG (Green Tea)** | ✅ Good | RCT showed 32.6% volume reduction |
| **DIM** | ⚠️ Indirect | Estrogen modulation, no direct fibroid studies |

## Vitamin D — Strong Evidence

**Bottom line:** Multiple RCTs show vitamin D can shrink fibroids or prevent growth.

### Meta-analysis (2024) — PMID 38234246
- 5 RCTs, 511 participants
- Vitamin D significantly decreased fibroid size (SMD: -0.48)
- Stronger effect with >8 weeks supplementation (SMD: -0.62)

### RCT (2020) — PMID 32379687
- 12-week trial
- Vitamin D group: fibroids stayed stable
- Placebo group: fibroids **grew** significantly

### Why It Works
- Women with fibroids have significantly lower vitamin D levels (~5.5 ng/mL difference)
- Vitamin D has anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects on fibroid cells

### Dosing
- Most studies used 50,000 IU weekly or equivalent daily doses
- Duration: 8+ weeks needed for effect
- Check your levels first — aim for 30+ ng/mL

## EGCG (Green Tea Extract) — Good Evidence

**Bottom line:** One solid RCT showed 32.6% fibroid volume reduction in 4 months.

### Pilot RCT (2013) — PMID 23950663
- 39 women with symptomatic fibroids (33 completed)
- Treatment: 800mg green tea extract (45% EGCG) daily for 4 months
- Results:
  - **32.6% reduction** in fibroid volume (vs 24.3% INCREASE in placebo)
  - 32.4% improvement in symptom severity
  - Anemia improved by 0.7 g/dL
  - Menstrual bleeding decreased from 71mL to 45mL/month
- No adverse effects observed

### Ongoing: FRIEND Trial — PMID 38216200
- Multicenter RCT currently studying EGCG for fibroids + fertility

### Why It Works
- Anti-proliferative (stops fibroid cells from multiplying)
- Anti-fibrotic (reduces abnormal tissue formation)
- Induces apoptosis in fibroid cells

### Dosing & Tips
- Study used 800mg green tea extract containing 45% EGCG (~360mg EGCG)
- **Recommended product:** Life Extension Mega Green Tea Extract (326mg EGCG, Labdoor verified 97.4/100)
- Take on empty stomach (morning)
- Take with vitamin C for better absorption
- Avoid protein/dairy for 30 min (blocks absorption)

## DIM (Diindolylmethane) — Combination Therapy for Growth Prevention

**Bottom line:** No direct fibroid shrinkage studies, BUT strong mechanistic rationale for preventing growth via estrogen metabolism modulation.

### The Science: Estrogen Metabolite Pathways

Estrogen gets metabolized through two main pathways:
- **2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1)** — "Protective" pathway, anti-proliferative
- **16α-hydroxyestrone (16α-OHE1)** — "Proliferative" pathway, stimulates cell growth

**DIM shifts the ratio toward 2-OHE1 (the good one).**

### Key Study: DIM's Effect on Estrogen Profile (2024) — PMID 39578798
- 909 women taking DIM vs 18,385 not taking DIM
- Subset of 53 women with before/after results
- **Result:** 2-hydroxyestrone:16-hydroxyestrone ratio significantly increased
- Total estrogens decreased

### Why 16α-hydroxyestrone Matters for Fibroids
- 16α-OHE1 is **mitogenic** — stimulates cell proliferation (PMID 10030690, 8593862)
- Fibroids are estrogen-dependent tumors
- Higher 16α-OHE1 = more growth stimulus
- By shifting metabolism away from 16α-OHE1, DIM may reduce the proliferative signal

### Timing: Pre-Ovulation Makes Sense
Amy's observation: "I take it leading up to ovulation and notice a huge difference"

This aligns with the science:
- Estrogen peaks just before ovulation
- That's when estrogen metabolism matters most
- DIM during this window optimizes the metabolite ratio when it counts

### The Combination Therapy Rationale

| Supplement | Role |
|------------|------|
| **Vitamin D** | Shrinks fibroids (anti-proliferative on fibroid cells) |
| **EGCG** | Shrinks fibroids (apoptosis, anti-fibrotic) |
| **DIM** | Prevents growth (shifts estrogen to less proliferative metabolites) |

**DIM doesn't shrink — it stabilizes.** It's the "don't let it get worse" part of the stack while Vitamin D and EGCG work on shrinkage.

### Dosing
- Typical dose: 100-200mg DIM daily (or 300mg DIM-BR formulation)
- Timing: Consider taking in the follicular phase (day 1 through ovulation)
- Can be taken with or without food

## Non-Surgical Procedures

### UAE (Uterine Artery Embolization)
- Blocks blood supply to fibroids, causing shrinkage
- Minimally invasive (interventional radiology)
- Quick recovery (1-2 weeks)
- FEMME Trial (NEJM 2020): Both UAE and myomectomy effective; myomectomy had slightly better QoL outcomes

### MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS)
- Completely non-invasive (no incisions)
- Uses heat to destroy fibroid tissue
- Not all fibroids are candidates (location/size limits)

### Myomectomy
- Surgical removal of fibroids, preserves uterus
- Better quality of life outcomes than UAE in trials
- Recovery: 2-6 weeks depending on approach

### Hysterectomy
- Definitive cure (100% effective)
- Major surgery, permanent
- Appropriate when other treatments fail or symptoms severe

## Size Thresholds

- **<3cm:** Usually watchable
- **3-5cm:** Monitor, treat if symptomatic
- **5-10cm:** Often needs treatment
- **>10cm:** Usually requires intervention

Subserosal fibroids (grow outward) typically cause fewer bleeding issues but more bulk/pressure symptoms.

## Recommended Protocol

### 1. Vitamin D
- **Check your levels first** — aim for 30+ ng/mL
- **Dose:** 50,000 IU weekly (or ~7,000 IU daily) — based on study protocols
- **When:** Take with a meal containing fat for better absorption
- **Duration:** 8+ weeks minimum for effect on fibroids
- **Product:** [Search Amazon for Vitamin D3 50,000 IU](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=vitamin+d3+50000+iu+third+party+tested)

### 2. EGCG (Green Tea Extract)
- **Product:** [Life Extension Mega Green Tea Extract](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Life+Extension+Mega+Green+Tea+Extract) — Labdoor verified 97.4/100, 326mg EGCG per capsule
- **Dose:** 1 capsule daily (~326mg EGCG, matches study dose of ~360mg)
- **When:** Take in the morning on an empty stomach
- **With:** Vitamin C (or citrus fruit) for better absorption
- **Avoid:** Protein and dairy for 30 minutes (blocks absorption)
- **Duration:** Study showed results at 4 months

### 3. Iron
- Continue for anemia support (symptom management, not fibroid shrinkage)

### 4. DIM (Estrogen Modulation)
- **Role:** Prevents growth by shifting estrogen metabolism toward protective pathway
- **Dose:** 100-200mg DIM daily
- **Timing:** Consider taking during follicular phase (day 1 through ovulation) when estrogen peaks
- **Product:** [Search Amazon for DIM supplement](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=DIM+supplement+third+party+tested)
- **Note:** Works synergistically with Vitamin D + EGCG — they shrink, DIM stabilizes

### 5. Monitoring
- 📅 Annual ultrasound to track fibroid size
- 💬 Discuss UAE/focused ultrasound options with doctor if needed
