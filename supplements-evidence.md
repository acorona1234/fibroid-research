## 🟢 VITAMIN D — Strong Evidence

**Bottom line:** Multiple RCTs show vitamin D can shrink fibroids or prevent growth.

### Key Studies

**Meta-analysis (2024) — PMID 38234246**
- 5 RCTs, 511 participants
- Vitamin D significantly decreased fibroid size (SMD: -0.48)
- Stronger effect with >8 weeks supplementation (SMD: -0.62)
- Also increased serum vitamin D levels

**RCT (2020) — PMID 32379687**
- 12-week trial
- Vitamin D group: fibroids stayed stable (slight decrease, not significant)
- Placebo group: fibroids **grew** significantly
- Conclusion: "Vitamin D consumption might inhibit growth"

**RCT (2021) — PMID 33687161**
- Studied vitamin D effect on fibroid recurrence after surgery
- Found protective effect

### Why It Works
- Women with fibroids have significantly lower vitamin D levels (meta-analysis: -5.50 ng/mL difference)
- Vitamin D has anti-proliferative effects on fibroid cells
- Also anti-inflammatory

### Dosing (from studies)
- Most studies used 50,000 IU weekly or equivalent daily doses
- Duration: 8+ weeks needed for effect
- Check your levels first — aim for sufficient status (30+ ng/mL)

## 🟢 EGCG (Green Tea Extract) — Good Evidence

**Bottom line:** One solid RCT showed 32.6% fibroid volume reduction in 4 months.

### Key Study

**Pilot RCT (2013) — PMID 23950663**
- 39 women with symptomatic fibroids
- Treatment: 800mg green tea extract (45% EGCG) daily for 4 months
- Results:
  - **32.6% reduction** in fibroid volume (vs 24.3% INCREASE in placebo)
  - 32.4% improvement in symptom severity
  - 18.5% improvement in quality of life
  - Anemia improved by 0.7 g/dL
  - Menstrual bleeding decreased from 71mL to 45mL/month
- No adverse effects observed

**Ongoing: FRIEND Trial — PMID 38216200**
- Multicenter RCT currently studying EGCG for fibroids + fertility
- Results pending

### Why It Works
- Anti-proliferative (stops fibroid cells from multiplying)
- Anti-fibrotic (reduces abnormal tissue formation)
- Induces apoptosis (programmed cell death in fibroid cells)
- Antioxidant properties

### Dosing
- Study used 800mg green tea extract containing 45% EGCG (~360mg EGCG)
- Take with food to reduce stomach upset
- Note: Green tea extract can affect liver in rare cases — monitor if taking long-term

## 🟡 DIM (Diindolylmethane) — Indirect/Theoretical Evidence

**Bottom line:** NO direct studies on DIM for fibroids. Evidence is for estrogen metabolism, not fibroid shrinkage.

### What the Evidence Shows
- DIM shifts estrogen metabolism toward "safer" metabolites (2-hydroxyestrone over 16α-hydroxyestrone)
- Studies exist for:
  - Cervical dysplasia (HPV)
  - Thyroid proliferative disease
  - General estrogen modulation
- **Zero PubMed results** for "DIM + uterine fibroids"

### Theoretical Rationale
- Fibroids are estrogen-dependent
- If DIM reduces "bad" estrogen metabolites, might help
- But this is **unproven** for fibroids specifically

### Current Status
Amy is taking DIM — likely not harmful, may help with estrogen balance, but:
- Not proven for fibroids
- Consider prioritizing supplements with actual fibroid evidence (Vitamin D, EGCG)

## 🔵 Iron — Symptom Management

**Context:** Amy is taking iron, which makes sense for heavy bleeding/anemia rather than shrinking fibroids.

- EGCG study showed anemia improved when fibroids shrank
- Iron is supportive care, not a fibroid treatment
- Important: Amy has noted hereditary low iron

---

## Combination Approach

**Study: Vitamin D + EGCG Together — PMID 34658291**
- Small pilot study in women >40 with fibroids
- Combined vitamin D and green tea extract
- Showed benefits for symptoms and quality of life
- Both supplements have complementary mechanisms

---

## Recommended Evidence-Based Stack

Based on the research:

1. **Vitamin D** — Check levels, supplement to sufficiency (50,000 IU/week or ~7,000 IU/day common in studies)
2. **EGCG/Green Tea Extract** — 800mg extract (45% EGCG) daily
3. **Iron** — Continue for anemia support
4. **DIM** — Can continue, but deprioritize; no direct fibroid evidence

*Always discuss with your doctor, especially dosing and interactions.*
